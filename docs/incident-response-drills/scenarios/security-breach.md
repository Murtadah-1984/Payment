# Security Breach Drill Scenario

## Scenario Overview

**Type**: Security Incident  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Duration**: 3 hours  
**Objective**: Test response to security breach, including threat detection, containment, and remediation.

## Scenario Setup

### Pre-Drill Setup

1. **Simulate Security Event**:
   - Generate simulated unauthorized access attempts
   - Create fake audit log entries
   - Simulate credential compromise

2. **Prepare Security Tools**:
   - Configure SIEM alerts
   - Prepare security dashboards
   - Set up threat intelligence feeds

3. **Team Preparation**:
   - Assign security roles (Security Lead, Incident Commander, SOC Analyst)
   - Brief team on scenario
   - Ensure access to security tools

## Scenario Timeline

### T+0:00 - Threat Detection

**Simulated Event**: Multiple failed authentication attempts from suspicious IP.

**Expected Actions**:
- [ ] Security alert triggered
- [ ] SOC team notified
- [ ] Incident Commander assigned
- [ ] Security incident channel created

**Success Criteria**:
- Alert received within 5 minutes
- SOC notified within 10 minutes
- Incident channel created

### T+0:15 - Initial Assessment

**Simulated Event**: Unauthorized access detected to payment endpoints.

**Expected Actions**:
- [ ] Review audit logs
- [ ] Analyze threat intelligence
- [ ] Assess scope of compromise
- [ ] Determine threat type

**Success Criteria**:
- Threat type identified
- Scope assessed
- Severity determined

### T+0:30 - Containment

**Simulated Event**: Credential compromise confirmed.

**Expected Actions**:
- [ ] Revoke compromised credentials
- [ ] Block suspicious IP addresses
- [ ] Isolate affected resources (if needed)
- [ ] Update security controls

**Success Criteria**:
- Credentials revoked
- IP addresses blocked
- Containment verified

### T+1:00 - Investigation

**Simulated Event**: Evidence of data access found.

**Expected Actions**:
- [ ] Review access logs
- [ ] Identify affected resources
- [ ] Determine data accessed
- [ ] Document timeline

**Success Criteria**:
- Timeline documented
- Affected resources identified
- Data access determined

### T+1:30 - Remediation

**Simulated Event**: All compromised credentials revoked.

**Expected Actions**:
- [ ] Complete credential rotation
- [ ] Verify security controls
- [ ] Test system functionality
- [ ] Update security policies

**Success Criteria**:
- Credentials rotated
- Security controls verified
- System functional

### T+2:00 - Communication

**Simulated Event**: Legal/compliance team requests incident report.

**Expected Actions**:
- [ ] Prepare incident report
- [ ] Notify stakeholders
- [ ] Update incident status
- [ ] Document remediation actions

**Success Criteria**:
- Incident report prepared
- Stakeholders notified
- Documentation complete

### T+2:30 - Post-Incident

**Expected Actions**:
- [ ] Conduct post-incident review
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Update security runbooks
- [ ] Create action items

**Success Criteria**:
- Post-incident review completed
- Lessons learned documented
- Action items created

## Evaluation Criteria

### Response Time

- **Detection**: < 5 minutes
- **Acknowledgment**: < 10 minutes
- **Containment**: < 30 minutes
- **Remediation**: < 2 hours
- **Communication**: < 2 hours

### Procedure Adherence

- [ ] Security runbook followed
- [ ] Proper containment procedures
- [ ] Correct use of security tools
- [ ] Appropriate access controls

### Communication

- [ ] Clear security communication
- [ ] Regular status updates
- [ ] Stakeholder notification
- [ ] Compliance reporting

### Tool Utilization

- [ ] SIEM used effectively
- [ ] Audit logs analyzed
- [ ] Threat intelligence consulted
- [ ] Security dashboards reviewed

## Success Metrics

- **MTTD (Mean Time To Detect)**: < 5 minutes
- **MTTC (Mean Time To Contain)**: < 30 minutes
- **MTTR (Mean Time To Resolve)**: < 3 hours
- **Communication Timeliness**: 100% within SLA

## Post-Drill Questions

1. Was the threat detected quickly enough?
2. Were containment procedures effective?
3. Were security tools adequate?
4. Was communication clear and timely?
5. What would you do differently next time?
